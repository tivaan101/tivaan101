            <p>Background</p>
            <p>Our website serves as a car tracking e-commerce platform with the goal of giving users access to real-time vehicle location data. Our goal is to provide a simple and effective solution for anyone who wish to track their cars for convenience, security, and peace of mind. Our website enables users to track the whereabouts of their vehicles at any time and from any location by combining cutting-edge GPS technology with an intuitive UI.

             <p>About this website<p>
             <p>To provide a dynamic and interactive user experience, a combination of PHP, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS were used in the development of the website. PHP was used to manage user authentication, handle database operations, and perform server-side scripting. The web pages were structured and styled using HTML and CSS, resulting in a visually pleasing layout and responsive design. For added interactivity, such as form validation and dynamic content updates, JavaScript was used. For effective data storage and retrieval, the website makes use of MySQL as the database management system. These technologies were selected in order to build a reliable and user-friendly car monitoring e-commerce website. They were also picked for their scalability, large community support, and reliability.</p>
             <p>accessing the website</p>

For admin:
Admin Dashboard: Only authorized administrators have access to this secure area. It offers a consolidated interface to control the website's backend operations, including handling customer orders, adding or changing products, and creating reports. The admin dashboard link typically points to a separate URL with limited access. </p>

              <p>admin area</p>
              <p>The admin area acts as a safe, password-protected component of the website that only authorized administrators can access. In order to ensure the seamless running of the automobile tracking e-commerce platform, it offers tools and functions for managing the website's backend operations, including adding or modifying products, receiving customer orders, creating reports, and executing administrative chores.</p>
              <p> explain how products are removed and added</p>
              <p>Through the admin dashboard, products can be added to and withdrawn from our website. Administrators with the required permissions can enter product information such as name, description, price, and photos in the product management area. The product is added to the website's database and made accessible for customers to view and buy when they submit the information. Similar to adding a product, administrators can delete a product by selecting it from the dashboard and using the available option. This will remove the product from the website.</p>

               <p>explain the shipping options</p>
               <p>Different shipping choices are available on our website, including weight- and price-based delivery rates. Weight-based shipping determines the cost of shipping depending on the weight of the items in the customer's shopping basket, whereas price-based shipping determines the cost of shipping based on the overall cost of the items. In order to give customers precise and clear shipping charges during the checkout process, administrators can configure the shipping rates and regulations based on weight or price ranges in the admin dashboard.</p>
                <p>order</p>
                <p>When a customer places an order on our website, the order information is recorded, and an email notification is sent to the admin. The admin must evaluate and process the order by verifying stock availability, making the shipment, and updating the order status appropriately.</p>
                <p>adding of new pages</p>
<p>Adding new pages to our website involves creating a new page template, filling it with the desired content, and linking it to the website's navigation menu for easy access. Pages on our website can be updated through the admin dashboard by selecting the desired page, making changes to the content or layout, and saving the updates.</p>

                 <p>explain the tools used on the website</p>
                 <p>We employ technologies like Google Analytics, which offers in-depth analytics and reporting on website traffic, user behavior, and conversion rates, to measure website performance and acquire insightful data.</p>
                 <p>explain how the website is set up</p>
                 <p>To create a website, you must first buy a domain name, pick a hosting company that offers the necessary technologies, install a web server, upload the website files, set up the database, and make sure the domain is configured correctly for a working and accessible website.</p>
